**S1 CL and Definition**
1. **Defining of Computational Linguistics**  
Brings computer and languages together. The specific study of language from a computational perspective. The study of of computer systems for understanding and generating natural language.
2. **Aims of the field**: To get computers to perform human language tasks.
3. **Different characteristics and applications**  
Sentimen analysis, dialogue system, speech recognition, machine translation, etc.
4. **Different perspectives (theory, methods, tasks)**  
- _Theory_: Describing content and format of descriptions of phenomena, including formulating abstract models/frameworks to understand underlying pricinciples governing language structures and behaviours. _Understanding_
- _Methods_: Developing tools, procedures, formalism to facilitate NLP/ML by creating algorithms/models. _Modeling_
- _Tasks_: applying methods to solve specific language tasks. _Utilising_
5. **Different methodologies (rule-based, statistical approaches)**  
- _Rule-based approaches_: Explicitly model language by defining set of linguistic rules and structures crafted by human experts. Reply on predefined sets of linguisitcs rule. Transparent, interpretable, but labour-intensive and struggle from complexity.
- _Statistical approaches_: Implicitly model language based on patterns and probabilities derived from large datasets, leaveraging statisitcal models and ML algorithms to learn these patterns. Handles complexity, struggle from limited training data.
- _How language is related to this_: Language is rule-govened yet shows statistical regularities. Rule-based capture explicit linguistic features, statistical embrace implicit statistical patterns. The interplay between them reflects the multidimensional nature of language in computational modeling.
6. **Relation to General Linguistics**
- GL is the study of human language as a universal and recognasible part of human behaviours and cognitive abilities.
- Common foundation in exploration of language
- Approches and Outlook: GL looks at all languages' universals and principles, CL deals more specifically with the technological aspects of language processing. GL covers entirety of human languages. CL focuses on pratical applications and the development. GL - theoretical foundations, CL - real application.
- CL can be viewed as an applied subset of GL, theoretical insights from the latter guide the CL models for practical language-specific tassks. Altogther contribute to our understanding of language.
7. **Main subtasks in NLP (NLU, NLG)** 
- NLU: mapping given NL input into useful representations, analysing different aspects of the input: lexicon (POS tagging), morphology (lemmatization), syntax (dependency parsing), discourse (anaphora resolution), pragmatics (sentiment detection).
- NLG: producing meaning natural language text from some more abstract representation: subtle (difficult to get it right), very domain-specific (systems are tailored to particular applications/tasks: e.g. generating weather reports vs. poems).


**S2 Encoding Language**
**Writing Systems**
- Alphabetic, Syllabic, Logographic 
How is language encoded on computers? (bits & bytes) 
Binary and Hexadecimal System 
Binary system is base 2, using the symbols 0 and 1 01101=0∗24+1∗23+1∗22+0∗21+1∗20 =13
Hexadecimal system is base 16, the numbers 0 to 9 and the letters A (=10) to F(=15)2are used 1 0
0xA8E=10∗16 +8∗16 +14∗16 =2702
Conversion: 4 positions in binary can be represented with 1 position in hexadecimal 
ASCII
ASCII uses 8 bits to store 256 characters, was developed for the Latin Alphabet (esp. English)
Served as basis for future encoding systems
You should be able to read and use the ASCII chart You should be able to discuss the necessity of a standardised coding table & the limitations of ASCII 
Unicode

has a single representation for every character UTF-8 allows for backwards compatibility with ASCII UTF-8 allows for variable length (first bits show how many bytes are used) 
0 ... → one byte
110... → two bytes (following: 10..) ... 
You should be able to discuss the advantages and limitations of unicode

TTR = #types #tokens

Supervised vs. Unsupervised ML 
Supervised: Labeled data through expert annotators.

2) train the model
3) test and cross-validate
4) evaluate 
Unsupervised: 
1) feature extraction
2) apply algorithm on dataset
3) inspect resulting structure 
How to evaluate a model
Recall, Precision, Accuracy, TNR
How are these calculated?
When should you use which measure? → Is it more important to catch everyone with the disease and maybe treat healthy patients, or is it better to miss some patients but be sure not to treat healthy people? Is it better to censor non-harmful tweets and make sure to censor every hate speech tweet ... ? 
4. NLP segmentation

POS tagging
Information on word type (noun, verb, etc)
Different granularity depending on corpus
Used to encode morphological and syntactical information of tokens, can be used to measure linguistic properties such as complexity o pronunciation
Often prerequisite for other NLP tasks
Methods for POS tagging
Rule-based
Use constraint grammars and lexicons to retrieved all candidate POS tags and the associated rules
They each rule on input sentence and exclude POS tag if tule does not fit
Statistical
Input a token sequence, assign a POS tag to each token, handle ambiguity by exploring different possible sequences
Rank each sequence by its statical probability using supervised ML
Challenges in POS tagging

Sometimes, various POS tags are possible (I can can a can of tuna) - context necessary
You should be able to annotate short sequences and discuss possible ambiguities including ways to resolve the ambiguity
Parsing

Constituency Parsing
Constituents: Group of words forming syntactic units (e.g. NPs)
Parsing assigns syntactic structures

Visualisations: Trees and parentheses notation. You should be able to read & create both forms
Challenge: Ambiguities, e.g. I saw the man with the telescope
Dependency Parsing

Relation have governor (head) and dependent 
Challenges: Attachment and corrpdinasion ambiguity
