## Assignment 04


### Question 1. 
Explain in natural language what character sequences are matched by the following regular expressions.<br>
(a) /Ha(ha)+!?/gi <br>
(b) /(\+49 |0)1615[0-9]{4}[5-9]{3}/g <br>

**Solutions** <br>
- (a) This regular expression matches a string that contains the pattern 'Ha, followed by one or more occurences of 'ha' and includes an exclamation mark '!' at the end. The 'gi' flags make the search case-insensitive (i) and perform a global search (g) to find all matches in the input string. <br>
- (b) This regular expression matches a sequence of phone numbers that start with either "+49" or "0", followed by the digits "1615", four numerical digits in the range 0 to 9, and then three numerical digits in the range 5 to 9. Flag "g" is sued to allow iterative searches (namely global search). <br>


### Question 2.
Try the same search in several different search engines (Google, Bing, Baidu, DuckDuckGo, Ecosia, or others). What similarities or differences do you observe in the results and their ranking, as well as in the user experience, design, and advertisements? Give examples of the queries you searched for, and limit your answer to 2 - 3 paragraphs. <br>

**Solutions** <br>
I have tried to search a video game called "Chained Echoes" in Google, Bing, and Ecosia respectively. <br>
Similarities: 
Differences: <br>
1. Display: Googles has 9 results on the first page 


### Question 3
Search the web for a Computer-Assisted Language Learning (CALL) application that uses Human Language Technology. Both commercial applications and applications from research projects are ac- ceptable. Next, describe the application in two or three paragraphs, being sure to include the following information:
- the name of the application you chose, and whether the system is a commercial application or a research project [1 point],
- the intended target users (i.e., the kind of people expected to use the application) [1 point],
- the type of language training offered by the app (e.g., listening comprehension, grammar practice, etc.), and what if any feedback is offered [2 points], and
- whether or not the app has the task of processing well-formed (i.e., native) language, language produced by learners, or both. [1 point]
Finally, speculate on which of the language technologies we have covered in class might be used in the CALL applicationâ€™s language processing pipeline. Examples of technology we have covered include dialogue systems, spell checking, language models, sentence segmentation, tokenization, POS tagging, parsing, and automatic speech recognition.
