## Assignment 04


### Question 1. 
Explain in natural language what character sequences are matched by the following regular expressions.<br>
(a) /Ha(ha)+!?/gi <br>
(b) /(\+49 |0)1615[0-9]{4}[5-9]{3}/g <br>

**Solutions** <br>
- (a) This regular expression matches a string that starts with 'Ha', followed by one or more occurences of 'ha' and includes an exclamation mark '!', and is case insensitive (i). Flag 'g' indicates a global search, namely it finds all matches in the input string. <br>
- (b) This regular expression matches a sequence of phone numbers that start with either "+49" or "0", followed by the digits "1615", and four numerical digits, and then three numerical digits btween 5 and 9. Flag "g" is sued to allow iterative searches (namely global search). <br>


### Question 2.
Try the same search in several different search engines (Google, Bing, Baidu, DuckDuckGo, Ecosia, or others). What similarities or differences do you observe in the results and their ranking, as well as in the user experience, design, and advertisements? Give examples of the queries you searched for, and limit your answer to 2 - 3 paragraphs. <br>
